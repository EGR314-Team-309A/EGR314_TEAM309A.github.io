## Team Charter

>Our team is dedicated to creating a working prototype that meets the project goals and helps us grow as engineers by building real-world skills and preparing for our future careers.

We came up with this statement by focusing on our top priorities as a team. We want to build a working prototype that not only meets the project goals but also helps us grow as engineers. This project is more than just an assignment, it’s a chance to develop real world skills and prepare for the careers we’re excited to pursue.

## Product Mission Statement

>Our mission is to create a practical, user-friendly product that inspires STEM learning and encourages engineering thinking for K-12 students

Our team used the core concept of inspiring K-12 STEM education do develop our mission statement. We wanted to create a product that not only encourages engineering thinking but is also practical and easy to use. Through discussion, we refined our statement to reflect our shared passion for STEM and how we can use that to make STEM education accessible and impactful.
