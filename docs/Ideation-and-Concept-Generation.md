## About Our Exhibit

Goal of our Exhibit

We want our exhibit to inspire future STEM students by showcasing the real-world capabilities of STEM concepts through a fun and interactive experience. To achieve this, our design focuses on engagement, creativity, and hands-on learning, ensuring that visitors are not only exposed to STEM principles but also actively participate in applying them. We aim to make STEM ideas accessible, exciting, and easy to explore, and we want to encourage a curiosity and problem-solving mindset with our users.

Target Audience

For this project, we know that our target audience is going to be high school students and some adults with a basic high school education. Since our showcase will be with ASU, the audience will have a varying amount of people with different backgrounds and involvement with the school. Most of the users will have done many projects or designs similar to what we may have, but we hope to get some younger users as well.

## Idea Generation

For our initial idea generation, we were focused mostly on generating ideas that seemed fun or interesting to our audience of highschool students. This includes things that are very interactive, visally interesting, or simply just cool looking. We wanted things that can catch the eye of this audience to entice them to view our exhibit.

## Sorted Ideas

After compiling our initial ideas, we sorted them into categories and started narrowing them down into ideas that suited our users best. We took a couple things into consideration.

1. How eye catching is the idea?
2. Will the user be able to easily understand and interact with it?
3. Does the idea encourage STEM based thinking or is it just a fun toy?
4. Is it safe to interact with?
5. Is it practical for us to make?

After narrowing down our ideas into a handful of options that meet the requirements for us and our users, we ultimatly decided that a spinning top was the best choice. We felt this option was very eye catching from afar so we could attract an audience. This option will also be easy and safe for our users to interact with if we make our HMI wireless. We also believe this will encourage STEM based thinking out of our users because a spinning top raises the question of how it balances. Overall, this idea is fun, interactive, and though provoking which is why we chose it for our project.

The Spinning Top Interactive Exhibit is designed to engage users with a interactive demonstration of balance, motion, and physics principles. Its motorized spinning mechanism, powered by a removable battery, ensures smooth and stable operation. There are adjustable PCB slots to ensure weight is distributed across the top to keep it balanced. The inner shell houses PCB components and ribbon cable slots, ensuring secure connections and minimal interference during operation. The motor at the base provides a user controlled speed, keeping the top upright and balanced. To enhance durability and safety, the exhibit features a wireless human-machine interface (HMI), allowing users to control the top remotely keeping it safe but still interactive. There are a couple of buttons to navigate the screen and monitor real-time speed data through a two-way internet connection, as well as control the motor on the top. We wanted to keep the controls simple to limit any learning curve for the users. An integrated gyroscope tracks rotation speed, providing data to the user and encouraging them to analyze how different speeds affect stability. Users will also be provided with labels and a basic tutorial on each HMI button and how to operate it. This will allow for simple and effective control between the users and exhibit. With its eye-catching motion, simple controls, and educational focus, the Spinning Top Interactive Exhibit offers a safe and engaging way to explore STEM concepts through real-world physics applications.
