## Final Reflections of EGR 314: Embedded Systems Design II

### Lessons Learned
- Working on this project as part of Team 309A in EGR314 provided us with a wide range of valuable technical and personal lessons:

- PCB and Schematic Design: We learned how to effectively design schematics and PCBs using industry-standard tools. This included labeling nets, organizing components, and ensuring logical flow for easier debugging and manufacturing.

- Industrial Communication Protocols: We gained hands-on experience working with SPI and I2C protocols—learning not only how to implement them in code but also how to troubleshoot issues like timing mismatches, improper wiring, or register configuration errors.

- Server and WiFi Setup Using Microcontrollers: We experimented with setting up local servers and WiFi communication using ESP32s in conjunction with our PIC microcontrollers, preparing us for future IoT or web-connected hardware applications.

- Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Programming: We developed a simple yet effective user interface to monitor and interact with our system, learning how to bridge low-level hardware control with user-facing functionality.

- Debugging and Testing with Oscilloscopes: Using lab tools like oscilloscopes helped us trace UART signals, validate logic levels, and verify protocol timing—skills that are essential for any embedded system engineer.

- Persistence in Debugging: One of the most important lessons was learning to stay persistent. Many bugs were not resolved quickly, and it took multiple iterations, logic reviews, and hardware checks to isolate and solve issues.

- Problem-Solving Under Pressure: At times, we were stuck without a clear path forward, but through brainstorming and cross-verifying each subsystem, we learned to logically decode issues and find working solutions.

- Work Ethic and Engineering Reality: We experienced firsthand what it takes to be an engineer—spending long hours, working weekends, and putting in extra effort to ensure the system functioned as expected.

- Team Communication and Collaboration: Clear communication between team members was essential. We coordinated changes, shared updates regularly, and supported each other through design and testing hurdles.

- Deliverable Management and Time Efficiency: Throughout the course, we improved our ability to produce correct and complete deliverables under tight deadlines, a critical skill in both academic and professional engineering environments.

### Recommendations for Future Students
- Start learning how to use MPLAB X and MCC early so that you are comfortable with configuring peripherals like SPI, UART, and I2C when the time comes.

- Get familiar with reading datasheets—they are your best source for understanding how to properly set up and control sensors, drivers, and microcontrollers.

- Prioritize clear team communication from day one to avoid duplicate work or design mismatches later in the semester.

- Regularly test individual subsystems before integrating them, as debugging a full system without knowing the behavior of its parts is very difficult.

- Keep up with your documentation and commit code often, so that your reports and demos are easier to assemble when deadlines are tight.
