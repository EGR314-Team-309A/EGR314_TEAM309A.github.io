## Intro

This website provides documentation for an embedded systems project. The project is a spinning top designed to provide a fun and interesting way to get high school students interested in STEM. This website is meant to document our team's ideas and decision-making process throughout the project's timeline. We also have individual websites to document our individual systems and provide more information for each section of our project.

# Team Summary  
We are Team 309A in the EGR314 class, developing an interactive sensor-actuator system using two custom-designed PCBs: one for a temperature sensor subsystem and the other for a motor driver subsystem. Each PCB uses a different communication protocol, with the sensor sending data via UART to the motor driver. The motor responds by changing speed or direction based on temperature values. In this way, by using a sensor and actuator, we fulfill the project requirements for a responsive, modular STEM-themed display.

Below are the individual datasheets of the team members along with their roles in the team.
