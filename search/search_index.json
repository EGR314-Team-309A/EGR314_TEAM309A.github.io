The inner shell houses PCB components and ribbon cable slots, ensuring secure connections and minimal interference during operation. The motor at the base provides a user controlled speed, keeping the top upright and balanced. An integrated temperature sensor senses the temperature values and sends them to the motor PCB using UART communication protocol.
